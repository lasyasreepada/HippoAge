# Epigenetic Signatures of Aging and Neurodegeneration
Lasya Sreepada - PhD Dissertation Project
## Aim II: Identify blood-based epigenetic signatures and associated biological pathways underlying brain aging and neurodegeneration in the MTL

To develop novel epigenetic clocks that specifically predict brain age and hippocampal volume, ML algorithms will be applied to whole-blood DNA methylation profiles
covering 700,000 CpGs across the epigenome. Various feature selection methods using nested cross validation with hyperparameter tuning will be implemented to preselect CpGs that have the greatest association with the target feature of interest (i.e., brain aging or hippocampal volume), and subsequent prediction performance will be assessed to identify the best feature selection method and number of features to input to an Elastic Net model. Training and validation be done with an initial discovery cohort and the final clock will be tested in an independent dataset to evaluate predictive performance. The CpGs selected by the ML models will be annotated using existing databases. Gene set enrichment and gene ontology analyses will be conducted to assess the biological implications of these features. Finally, the relationship between methylation of the selected CpGs and brain methylation, as well as the relationship to blood and brain gene expression, will be analyzed to infer the ability of blood-based methylation profiles to inform brain-related processes. Working Hypothesis: Epigenetic modifiers measured in blood are predictive of brain aging and neurodegenerative processes affecting the MTL.
